=====

Base Usage
----------
Creating optimal lineups with **pydfs-lineup-optimizer** is very simple.
Firstly you should create optimizer. You can do this using
shortcut get_optimizer. You must provide daily fantasy site for it and kind of sport.
If site doesn't support specified sport you will get NotImplementedError.

.. code-block:: python

    from pydfs_lineup_optimizer import get_optimizer, Site, Sport


    optimizer = get_optimizer(Site.FANDUEL, Sport.BASKETBALL)

After that you need to load players into your optimizer. You have 2 options:
First is to load players from CSV file like this:

.. code-block:: python

    optimizer.load_players_from_csv("path_to_csv")

.. note::

   CSV file must have the same format as export file in specified dfs site, if you have custom CSV file this method will not work.
   Also this method raises `NotImplementedError` for FanBall site because it hasn't export csv feature.

Or you can load players using load_players method and pass list with players.

.. code-block:: python

    from pydfs_lineup_optimizer import Player
    optimizer.load_players(players)  # players is list of Player objects

After player loading you can create your optimal lineups with following code:

.. code-block:: python

    lineups = optimizer.optimize(n=10)

Where n is a number of lineups that you want generate.

.. note::

   Optimize method returns generator instead of list.

Example of base usage
---------------------

Below is a full example of how **pydfs-lineup-optimizer** can be used to generate optimal lineups.

.. code-block:: python

    optimizer = get_optimizer(Site.YAHOO, Sport.BASKETBALL)
    optimizer.load_players_from_csv("yahoo-NBA.csv")
    for lineup in optimizer.optimize(n=10):
        print(lineup)
        print(lineup.players)  # list of players
        print(lineup.fantasy_points_projection)
        print(lineup.salary_costs)

Advanced Usage
--------------

For generating optimal lineups you may need to lock some players that you want to see in your lineup.
You can do this using following code:

.. code-block:: python

    player = optimizer.get_player_by_name('Rodney Hood') # find player with specified name in your optimizer
    second_player = optimizer.get_player_by_id('ID00001')  # find player with player id
    optimizer.add_player_to_lineup(player) # lock this player in lineup
    optimizer.add_player_to_lineup(second_player)

Locked players can be unlocked as well:

.. code-block:: python

    optimizer.remove_player_from_lineup(player)

Also you can exclude some players from optimization process and restore players as well:

.. code-block:: python

    optimizer.remove_player(player)
    optimizer.restore_player(player)

You can specify maximum and minimum exposures for some players or max exposure for all players, you have several ways how to do this.
You can add "Max Exposure" and "Min Exposure" columns with exposure percentage for some players to csv that will be parsed while players loading.
Or you can set max_exposure/min_exposure property in Player object. If you want to set fixed max exposure for all players you can
pass max_exposure parameter to optimize method

.. code-block:: python

    player = optimizer.players[0]  # get random player from optimizer players
    player.max_exposure = 0.5  # set 50% max exposure
    player.min_exposure = 0.3  # set 30% min exposure

    lineups = optimizer.optimize(n=10, max_exposure=0.3)  # set 30% exposure for all players

.. note::

   Exposure working with locked players, so if you lock some player and set max exposure to 50% percentage
   this player will appears only in 50% lineups.
   Player max exposure has higher priority than max_exposure passed in optimize method.
   Exposure percentage rounds to ceil.

Optimizer also have randomness feature. It adds some deviation for players projection for
creating less optimized but more randomized lineups. For activating randomness feature you should set randomness parameter to True.
By default min deviation is 6% and max deviation is 12%. You can change it with set_deviation method.
You also can specify player specific deviation using `min_deviation` and `max_deviation` attributes for player,
or using additional columns `Min Deviation` and `Max Deviation` in import csv.

.. code-block:: python

    lineups = optimizer.optimize(n=10, randomness=True)
    lineups = optimizer.set_deviation(0.2, 0.4)  # for making more random lineups
    harden = optimizer.get_player_by_name('Harden')
    harden.min_deviation = 0.3
    harden.max_deviation = 0.6
    westbrook = optimizer.get_player_by_name('Westbrook')
    westbrook.min_deviation = 0  # Disable randomness for this player
    westbrook.max_deviation = 0
    lineups = optimizer.optimize(n=10, randomness=True)

.. note::

    With randomness = True optimizer generate lineups without ordering by max points projection.

Example of advanced usage
-------------------------

Below is an full example of how **pydfs-lineup-optimizer** can be used to generate optimal lineups with user constraints.

.. code-block:: python

    optimizer = get_optimizer(Site.YAHOO, Sport.BASKETBALL)
    optimizer.load_players_from_csv("yahoo-NBA.csv")
    nets_centers = filter(lambda p: p.team == 'Nets' and 'C' in p.positions, optimizer.players)
    for player in nets_centers:
        optimizer.remove_player(player)  # Remove all Nets centers from optimizer
    harden = optimizer.get_player_by_name('Harden')
    westbrook = optimizer.get_player_by_name('Westbrook')  # Get Harden and Westbrook
    harden.max_exposure = 0.6
    westbrook.max_exposure = 0.4  # Set exposures for Harden and Westbrook
    optimizer.add_player_to_lineup(harden)
    optimizer.add_player_to_lineup(westbrook)  # Lock Harden and Westbrook
    for lineup in optimizer.optimize(n=10, max_exposure=0.3):
        print(lineup)

DraftKings Late-Swap
--------------------

Optimizer provides additional functionality for DK that allows to re-optimize existed lineups.
For this you should load lineups, you can do it from csv file generated in DK lobby for specific contest.
Then you should pass loaded lineups to `optimize_lineups` method.
Players with started game will be locked on specific positions and optimizer will change only players with upcoming game.

.. code-block:: python

    csv_filename = "dk_nba.csv"
    optimizer = get_optimizer(Site.DRAFTKINGS, Sport.BASKETBALL)
    optimizer.load_players_from_csv(csv_filename)
    lineups = optimizer.load_lineups_from_csv(csv_filename)
    for lineup in optimizer.optimize_lineups(lineups):
        print(lineup)

For parsing dates of games library uses US/Eastern timezone by default.
You can change it using `set_timezone` function:

.. code-block:: python

    from pydfs_lineup_optimizer import set_timezone

    set_timezone('UTC')
